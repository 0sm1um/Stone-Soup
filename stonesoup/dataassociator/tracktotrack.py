    """Track to track associator based on the Counting Technique

    Compares two sets of :class:`~.tracks`, each formed of a sequence of
    :class:`~.State` objects and returns an :class:`~.Association` object for
    each time at which the two :class:`~.State` within the :class:`~.tracks`
    are assessed to be associated.

    Uses an algorithm called the Counting Technique [1]_.
    Associations are triggered by track states being within a threshold
    distance for a given number of timestamps. Associations are terminated when
    either the two :class:`~.tracks` end or the two :class:`~.State` are
    separated by a distance greater than the threshold at the next time step.

    Note

    Association is not prioritised based on historic associations or distance.
    If, at a specific time step, the :class:`~.State` of one of the
    :class:`~.tracks` is assessed as close to more than one track then an
    :class:`~.Association` object will be return for all possible association
    combinations.
