# %%
# 
# This tutorial introduces the sensor manager classes in Stone Soup which can be used to build simple sensor management
# algorithms for tracking and state estimation. The intention is to further build on these base classes to develop more
# complicated sensor management algorithms.
# 
# Background
# ----------
# 
# Sensor management is the process of deciding and executing the actions that a sensor or group of sensors
# will take in a specific scenario and with a particular objective, or objectives in mind. The process
# involves using information about the scenario to determine an appropriate action for the sensing system
# to take. An observation of the state of the system is then made using the sensing configuration decided
# by the sensor manager. The observations are used to update the estimate of the collective states and this
# update is used (if necessary) to determine the next action for the sensing system to take.
# 
# A simple example can be imagined using a sensor with a limited field of view which must decide which direction
# it should point in at each time step. Alternatively, we might construct an objective based example by imagining
# that the desired target is fast moving and the sensor can only observe one target at a time. If there are
# multiple targets which could be observed the sensor manager could choose to observe the target that had the
# greatest estimated velocity at the current time.
# 
# The example in this notebook considers two simple sensor management methods and applies them to the same
# ground truths in order to quantify the difference in behaviour. The scenario simulates 10 targets moving on
# nearly constant velocity trajectories and a radar with a specified field of view, which can be pointed in a
# particular direction.
# 
# The first method, using the class :class:`~.RandomSensorManager` chooses a direction to point in randomly
# with equal probability. The
# second method, using the class :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager` considers every possible direction the
# sensor could point in and uses a
# reward function to determine the best choice of action.
# In this example the reward function aims to reduce the total uncertainty of the track estimates at each time step.
# To achieve this the sensor manager chooses to look in the direction which results in the greatest reduction in
# uncertainty - as represented by
# the Frobenius norm of the covariance matrix.
#
# Sensor management as a POMDP
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Sensor management problems can be considered as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) where
# observations provide information about the current state of the system but there is uncertainty in the estimate
# of the underlying state due to noisy sensors and imprecise models of target evaluation.
# 
# POMDPs consist of:
#  * :math:`X_k`, the finite set of possible states for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`A_k`, the finite set of possible actions for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`R_k(x, a)`, the reward function.
#  * :math:`Z_k`, the finite set of possible observations for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`f_k(x_{k}|x_{k-1})`, a (set of) state transition function(s). (Note that actions are excluded from
#    the function at the moment. It may be necessary to include them if prior sensor actions cause the targets to
#    modify their behaviour.)
#  * :math:`h_k(z_k | x_k, a_k)`, a (set of) observation function(s).
#  * :math:`\{x\}_k`, the set of states at :math:`k` to be estimated.
#  * :math:`\{a\}_k`, a set of actions at :math:`k` to be chosen.
#  * :math:`\{z\}_k`, the observations at :math:`k` returned by the sensor.
#  * :math:`\Psi_{k-1}`, denotes the complete set of 'intelligence' available to the sensor manager before deciding
#    on an action at :math:`k`. This includes the prior set of state estimates :math:`\{x\}_{k-1}`, but may also
#    encompass contextual information, sensor constraints or mission parameters.

#   :alt: Illustration of sequential actions and measurements
#
# :math:`\Psi_k` is the intelligence available to the sensor manager at stage index :math:`k`, to help
# select the action :math:`a_k` for the system to take. An observation :math:`z_k` is made by the sensing system,
# giving information on the state :math:`x_k`. The action :math:`a_k` and observation :math:`z_k` are added to the
# intelligence set to generate :math:`\Psi_{k+1}`, the intelligence available at stage index :math:`k+1`.
#
# Comparing sensor management methods using metrics
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The performance of the two sensor management methods explored in this tutorial can be assessed using metrics
# available from the Stone Soup framework. The metrics used to assess the performance of the different methods
# are the OPSA metric [#]_, SIAP metrics [#]_ and an uncertainty metric. Demonstration of the OSPA and SIAP metrics
# can be found in the Metrics Example.
# 
# The uncertainty metric computes the covariance matrices of all target states at each time step and calculates the
# sum of their norms. This gives a measure of the total uncertainty across all tracks at each time step.

# Sensor Management example
# -------------------------
# 
# Setup
# ^^^^^
# 
# First a simulation must be set up using components from Stone Soup. For this the following imports are required.

import numpy as np

from stonesoup.types.hypothesis import SingleHypothesis
from stonesoup.types.detection import Detection

# %%
# Generate ground truths
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# Following the methods from previous Stone Soup tutorials we generate a series of combined linear Gaussian transition
# models and generate ground truths. Each ground truth is offset in the y-direction by 10.
# 
# The number of targets in this simulation is defined by `n_truths` - here there are 10 targets. The time the
# simulation is observed for is defined by `time_max`.
# 
# We can fix our random number generator in order to probe a particular example repeatedly. This can be undone by
# commenting out the first two lines in the next cell.

# Generate ground truths
for j in range(0, ntruths):
    truth = GroundTruthPath([GroundTruthState([0, 1, yps[j], 1], timestamp=start_time)],
                            id=f"id{j}")

# %%
# Create sensors
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Create a sensor for each sensor management algorithm. This tutorial uses a specifically developed sensor
# :class:`~.SimpleRadar`. The sensor is capable of returning the actions it can possibly take at a given time step,
# i.e. the possible angles it can be pointed in. It can also be given an action to take before taking
# measurements - in this case changing the dwell centre to point in a specific direction.

# %%
# Create the Kalman predictor and updater
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Construct a predictor and updater using the :class:`~.KalmanPredictor` and :class:`~.ExtendedKalmanUpdater`

# %%
# Run the Kalman filters
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# First create `ntruths` priors which estimate the targetsâ€™ initial states, one for each target. In this example
# each prior is offset by 0.5 in the y direction meaning the position of the track is initially not very accurate. The
# velocity is also systematically offset by +0.5 in both the x and y directions.

                      timestamp=start_time))

# %%
# Initialise the tracks by creating an empty list and appending the priors generated. This needs to be done separately
# for both sensor manager methods as they will generate different sets of tracks.

# Create sensor managers
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Next we create our sensor manager classes. Two sensor manager classes are used in this tutorial
# - :class:`~.RandomSensorManager` and :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager`.
# 
# Random sensor manager
# """""""""""""""""""""
# 
# The first method :class:`~.RandomSensorManager`, randomly chooses the action(s) for the sensor to take
# to make an observation. To do this the :meth:`choose_actions`

# at each time step.

# Brute force sensor manager
# """"""""""""""""""""""""""
# 
# The second method :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager` iterates through every possible action a sensor can take at a
# given time step and selects the action(s) which give the maximum reward as calculated by the reward function.
# In this example the reward function is used to select a direction for the sensor to point in
# such that the total uncertainty of the tracks will be
# reduced the most by making an observation in that direction.

# The :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager` generally results in a smaller OSPA distance

# SIAP metrics
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Next we look at SIAP metrics. This can be done by generating a table which displays all the SIAP metrics computed,
# as seen in the Metrics Example.
# However, completeness, ambiguity and spuriousness are not relevant for this example because we are not initiating and
# deleting tracks and we have one track corresponding to each ground truth. Here we only plot positional accuracy and
# velocity accuracy over time.

# %%
# This metric shows that the uncertainty in the tracks generated by the :class:`~.RandomSensorManager` is much greater
# than for those generated by the :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager`. This is also reflected by the uncertainty ellipses
# in the initial plots of tracks and truths.
# 
# The uncertainty for the :class:`~.BruteForceSensorManager` remains small but can begin to increase
# towards the end of the simulation in some scenarios. This could be due to a small number of targets going unobserved
# for too long and the estimated location being too far from the truth. This could result in the sensor manager
# pointing the sensor in a direction in which the manager thinks it will observe a target but the target
# is not where it is expected to be.
