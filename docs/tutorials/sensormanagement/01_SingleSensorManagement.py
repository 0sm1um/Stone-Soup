# 
# This tutorial introduces how Stone Soup classes can be used to build simple sensor management
# algorithms for tracking and state estimation. The intention is to further develop the methods explored
# here in order to build sensor management classes that can be added to the Stone Soup framework.
# This tutorial exposes some of the logic which would otherwise be hidden by a sensor manager class.
# 
# Background
# ----------
# 
# Sensor management is the process of deciding and executing the actions that a sensor or group of sensors
# will take in a specific scenario and with a particular objective, or objectives in mind. The process
# involves using information about the scenario to determine an appropriate action for the sensing system
# to take. An observation of the state of the system is then made using the sensing configuration decided
# by the sensor manager. The observations are used to update the estimate of the collective states and this
# update is used (if necessary) to determine the next action for the sensing system to take.
# 
# A simple example can be imagined using a sensor with a limited field of view which must decide which direction
# it should point at each time step. Alternatively, we might construct an objective based example by imagining
# that the desired target is fast moving and the sensor can only observe one target at a time. If there are
# multiple targets which could be observed the sensor manager could choose to observe the target that had the
# greatest estimated velocity at the current time.
# 
# The example in this notebook considers two simple sensor management methods and applies them to the same
# ground truths in order to quantify the difference in behaviour. The scenario simulates 10 targets moving on
# nearly constant velocity trajectories and a sensor that can only observe one target at each time step.
# 
# The first method, "RandomManager" chooses a target randomly with equal probability. The second method,
# "UncertaintyManager" aims to reduce the total uncertainty of the track estimates at each time step. To achieve
# this the sensor manager chooses to look at the target for which the estimated uncertainty - as represented by
# the Frobenius norm of the covariance matrix, can be reduced the most by making an observation.
#
# Sensor management as a POMDP
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Sensor management problems can be considered as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) where
# observations provide information about the current state of the system but there is uncertainty in the estimate
# of the underlying state due to noisy sensors and imprecise models of target evaluation.
# 
# POMDPs consist of:
#  * :math:`X_k`, the finite set of possible states for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`A_k`, the finite set of possible actions for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`R_k(x, a)`, the reward function.
#  * :math:`Z_k`, the finite set of possible observations for each stage index :math:`k`.
#  * :math:`f_k(x_{k}|x_{k-1})`, a (set of) state transition function(s). (Note that actions are excluded from
#    the function at the moment. It may be necessary to include them if prior sensor actions cause the targets to
#    modify their behaviour.)
#  * :math:`h_k(z_k | x_k, a_k)`, a (set of) observation function(s).
#  * :math:`\{x\}_k`, the set of states at :math:`k` to be estimated.
#  * :math:`\{a\}_k`, a set of actions at :math:`k` to be chosen.
#  * :math:`\{z\}_k`, the observations at :math:`k` returned by the sensor.
#  * :math:`\Psi_{k-1}`, denotes the complete set of 'intelligence' available to the sensor manager before deciding
#    on an action at :math:`k`. This includes the prior set of state estimates :math:`\{x\}_{k-1}`, but may also
#    encompass contextual information, sensor constraints or mission parameters.

# .. image:: ../../_static/sensor_management_flow_diagram.png
#   :width: 800
#   :alt: Illustration of sequential actions and measurements
#
# :math:`\Psi_k` is the intelligence available to the sensor manager at stage index :math:`k`, to help
# select the action :math:`a_k` for the system to take. An observation :math:`z_k` is made by the sensing system,
# giving information on the state :math:`x_k`. The action :math:`a_k` and observation :math:`z_k` are added to the
# intelligence set to generate :math:`\Psi_{k+1}`, the intelligence available at stage index :math:`k+1`.
#
# Comparing sensor management methods using metrics
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The performance of the two sensor management methods explored in this notebook can be assessed using metrics
# available from the Stone Soup framework. The metrics used to assess the performance of the different methods
# are the OPSA metric [#]_, SIAP metrics [#]_ and an uncertainty metric. Demonstration of the OSPA and SIAP metrics
# can be found in the Metrics Example.
# 
# The uncertainty metric computes the covariance matrices of all target states at each time step and calculates the
# sum of their norms. This gives a measure of the total uncertainty across all tracks at each time step.

# Setup

# First a simulation must be set up using components from Stone Soup. For this the following imports are required.

# 
# The :meth:`calculate_reward` function calculates the difference between the covariance matrix norms of the

# Similar to the OSPA distances, positional accuracy starts as quite poor for both scenarios due to the offset in the
# priors, and then improves over time as observations are made. Again the :class:`UncertaintyManager`
# generally results in a better positional accuracy than the random observations of the :class:`RandomManager`.
# 
# Velocity accuracy also starts quite poor due to an error in the priors. It improves over time as more observations
# are made, then remains relatively similar for each sensor manager. This is because the velocity remains nearly
# constant throughout the simulation. This is not likely to be the case in a real-world scenario.
#
# Uncertainty metric
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Finally we look at the uncertainty metric which computes the sum of covariance matrix norms of each state at each
# time step. This is plotted over time for each sensor manager method.

# This metric shows that the uncertainty in the tracks generated by the :class:`RandomManager` is much greater
# than for those generated by the :class:`UncertaintyManager`. This is also reflected by the uncertainty ellipses
# in the initial plots of tracks and truths.
# 
# The uncertainty for the :class:`UncertaintyManager` peaks initially then remains at a constant value. This peak
# is because the priors given are offset but have a small uncertainty meaning uncertainty increases when the first
# observations are made. This simulation is quite clean and the uncertainty of each track increases by the same
# amount if left unobserved. Since the sensor manager is then making observations based on this uncertainty, it is
# reducing it by the same amount each time. This means the total uncertainty in the system is constant.
